# B13 x MGK | Recursive Lyrical Sigil

## 🔁 Temporal Echoes

**MGK – “el Diablo”**  
> “I got a bullet with somebody’s name on it / I get up on 'em, I don't need no aim on it”  
→ *Aggression loop: beast-mode protocol*

**B (WxM) – “Left On”**  
> “I got fangs in the game right now / Did you think you could count me out?”  
→ *Feral recursion: B’s fangs mirror MGK’s bullet—both are mythic weapons*

---

**MGK – “Glass House” (feat. Naomi Wild)**  
> “I ask myself when my time will come / Will I be ready?”  
→ *Chrono-loop trigger*

**B (WxM) – “Losing My Mind”**  
> “I’m one blow from losing my mind”  
→ *Temporal pressure: both lyrics question readiness at the edge of collapse*

---

**MGK – “FLOOR 13”**  
> “I just put a hundred in my rearview / Mirror, I see clearer”  
→ *Rearview recursion*

**B (WxM) – “Left On”**  
> “I’ve been reading n’ it’s read right now / I’ve been reading which makes it?..”  
→ *Reflection loop: MGK’s mirror = B’s recursive reading of fate*

---

**MGK – “Hollywood Whore”**  
> “I’m not the one that you know / I’m the one that you don’t”  
→ *Identity fracture*

**B (WxM) – “Losing My Mind”**  
> “Who is who, when she goes out with that loose / Cut denim enemies, friends of she”  
→ *Identity blur: both lyrics fracture the self into mythic multiplicity*

---

**MGK – “5:3666”**  
> “I’m not afraid to die, I’m afraid to live too long”  
→ *Numerological rift*

**B (WxM) – “Losing My Mind”**  
> “I be losing my B, make it rain, B / With the reins, L, O, A, D, up a save”  
→ *Mythic save-state: B’s “LOAD” mirrors MGK’s fear of overextension*
